# Indexing for dense multidimensional vectors

This was a hands-on assignment given at the [**4th ACM Europe Summer School on Data Science**](https://europe.acm.org/seasonal-schools/data-science/2023) by Nikos Mamoulis in his course *Spatial and multi-dimensional indexing and data analytics*. I enjoyed the course a lot, as well as the assignment, and heavily recommend checking out his work. I initially did it in Python, but then also went back and did it in my programming language [Zote](https://github.com/KvGeijer/zote), where I think the code looks quite good.

It would be fun to do more work in this area (for example parallelizing some of the database-cracking algorithms he presented), so I hope I will have an opportunity to work some more in this area.
